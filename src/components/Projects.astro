    <p>
      I developed a robust Attendance System backend designed to handle
      real-time attendance tracking through RabbitMQ. Multiple client
      applications connect to a central exchange, sending timestamped attendance
      records via message queues. The backend not only processes and stores
      these records efficiently but also maintains detailed control over each
      employeeâ€™s status, including their current location, assigned manager, and
      job role. This architecture ensures scalability, accurate data
      synchronization, and centralized workforce monitoring across distributed
      environments.
